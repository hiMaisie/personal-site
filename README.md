# Personal Website

[link](https://mbell.dev)

javascript was a mistake

this site is a react app that is rendered and deployed to github pages
whenever a tag is pushed to the repository.

`react-snapshot` is used in conjunction with `react-helmet` to generate
static pages, so that `<meta>` works.

this really should have been a static site and I'd like to apologise to
everyone for creating this. bless this mess
