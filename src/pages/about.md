I try to pay attention to as many areas of tech as possible, with particular
expertise in devops and backend development. Stuff I'm particularly
interested in include the [Go](https://golang.org) programming language, and
the [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) orchestration tool.

## Experience

### Limejump Ltd.

**Full Stack Developer**, June 2019 to present

I'm working on the energy trading and dispatching platforms for the business.
Currently I'm also leading ongoing work to migrate team-owned services from
Amazon ECS to Kubernetes, to align with wider business strategy and to allow
the team to increase release cadence and reliability.

I set up and am running the internal [Go](https://golang.org) Special Interest
Group, a slack channel and fortnightly meeting where developers working on Go
projects can ask questions, get advice, and show off things they have been
working on. It also provides us with an opportunity to standardise on libraries
between teams. This was heavily inspired by the Go Working Group detailed by
the Sainsbury's technology team in their talk about testing at the
[Gophers London meetup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxUYSktrEXc).

> Go Working Group
>
> A strong Go engineer **steers** the group
>
> Bring together people who work with Go **in the team**
>
> Discuss and decide which **tools to adopt**
>
> **No compromise** on Go/Engineering standards

### State Street Bank

**Microservices Framework Engineer**, July 2018 to May 2019

I joined State Street as a fresh-faced graduate in 2018. There, I worked as the
one junior in a team of highly seasoned devops engineers working to build out a
platform as a service offering for the company internally. I worked on the
Kubernetes team, aiming to provision ad-hoc Kubernetes clusters to developer
teams across the business.

I got to learn Kubernetes in instrinsic detail during my time there, as well as
working in an Agile softawre development team. Work I'm particularly proud of
includes deploying two critical platform tools (a build artifact server and a
[Continuous Integration](https://concourse-ci.org) server), and working on
educating other teams about using the tools effectively.
